NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandResult - Insert the result of command
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCommandResult (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCommandResult), released on 2014-12-12.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCommandResult]

    In your POD:

     # COMMAND: netstat -anp

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# COMMAND: ..." directives in your POD, pass it to
    the Perl's backtick operator, and insert the result into your POD as a
    verbatim paragraph. If command fails ($? is non-zero), build will be
    aborted.

SEE ALSO
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult, which can also be used to
    accomplish the same thing, e.g. with "# CODE: my $res = `netstat -anp`;
    die if $?; $res" except the DZP::InstallCommandResult plugin is shorter.
